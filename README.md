This is a demo project built to demonstrate some of the best features of [APIC](https://apic.app), specially the [User Session recorder](https://docs.apic.app/capture-and-test-api-from-real-user-sessions) and how to import and test APIs from a real user session. To view the application headover https://apic.app/demo

## API Designing features
- Defining your API endpoints, request parameters, request headers and response schema. [Know more here](https://docs.apic.app/designer/create-endpoint "Know more here").
- Defining reusable model definitions using a powerful schema builder. [more >>](https://docs.apic.app/designer/create-model "Know more here")
- You can also start writing tests for your APIs even during API designing. And the best part is you can do that even writing a single line of code just from the UI. [more >>](https://docs.apic.app/designer/write-api-tests-starting-from-design-phase "Know more here").
- Use the API Simulator so that your frontend team can keep working even if the API is not ready. [more >>](https://docs.apic.app/simulator "Know more here").

## API Testing features
- Obviously test your APIs
- Test Web Sockets, Socket.io, STOMP and Server Sent Events (SSE)
- Using Environment variables to switch between environments like local, Dev, QA, Pre-prod etc.
- Response schema validation as per your API design.
- Add tests to your APIs [directly from the response](https://docs.apic.app/tester/using-test-builder "directly from the response") or if you want to get more technical use [Chai.js to write tests](https://docs.apic.app/tester/writing-test-cases "Chai.js to write tests").
- Create [Test Projects and Test Suites](https://docs.apic.app/tester/creating-test-suits "Test Projects and Test Suites") to test various API scenarios and export test report.
- Add your Test Suites to your CI/CD platform with [apic-cli](https://docs.apic.app/cicd-integration "apic-cli").

## API Documentation
Once your API design is done APIC automatically converts your APIs designs into [beautiful functional documentations](https://docs.apic.app/docs "beautiful functional documentations") that will help others to get on board faster. You can even share it with the world by [publishing it online](https://docs.apic.app/dashboard/published-docs "publishing it online") with APIC.
